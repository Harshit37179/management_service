The Smart Management Service Portal is a web-based solution developed to streamline and automate the maintenance request process in multi-building infrastructures such as schools, colleges, and office buildings. The platform provides a centralized system where users (building managers, staff, or administrators) can report appliance issues, and the system will automatically notify the appropriate service provider based on the appliance type and location.

Users can manage appliances, categorize them by room number and floor, and assign unique names for easier identification. The application allows for custom service provider management, enabling users to update email addresses, phone numbers, and locations for different appliance types—ensuring that each maintenance request reaches the right technician or company.

The system includes a login and signup feature to manage user accounts and ensure personalized data management. Once logged in, users can submit an issue by entering the appliance name, room number, floor number, and a brief description of the problem. The system uses this information to identify the appliance type and automatically send an email notification to the relevant service provider using email APIs.

The application’s interface is built with React.js, offering a clean, responsive, and user-friendly experience. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express, handles authentication, data storage, and email automation, while MongoDB stores the structured data related to users, appliances, and service providers.

This portal enhances efficiency in facility maintenance by reducing manual communication and providing a smart, automated, and editable environment for managing service-related tasks across various buildings.
